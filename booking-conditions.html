                <p>Classic Alpine Ski Club is a trading division of The Mountain Experience Company Limited. If you’re booking a skiing holiday with us, your contract is with The Mountain Experience Company Limited (Company Number 9537139). Please read these conditions carefully as they set out what you are legally entitled to expect from us when you buy our holiday services. “You” and “your” means all persons named in the booking.</p>
                <h3>OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU</h3>
                <h4>Responsibility for your holiday</h4>
                <p>We are responsible for ensuring that each part of the holiday you book with us is provided to a proper standard and as was advertised by us, or changed and accepted by you. We have taken all reasonable care to make sure that all the services which make up your holiday are provided by efficient and reputable businesses.</p>
                <p>We accept liability for matters which arise as a direct result of our negligence or breach of duty to exercise care in making arrangements for you including any acts or omissions by our employees or agents while they are operating within the scope of their normal duties. Furthermore, we will accept liability for any negligent act or omission of our suppliers, who operate elements of your holiday arrangements, including any claim involving death, personal injury or illness. In respect of carriage by air or road and the provision of accommodation, our liability in all cases will be limited in accordance with the relevant international conventions or the conditions of the supplier.</p>
                <p>Due care has been taken to ensure that the descriptions, facts and opinions in our brochures are accurate at the time of publishing. The layout and furnishing of rooms shown in photographs may change. During the lifespan of our brochure, advertised services, facilities, schedules and laws may change. Errors may occasionally occur. It is therefore important that you check all the details of your holiday at the time of booking.</p>
                <h4>Price</h4>
                <p>The prices published in this brochure, in our marketing material and on our website are based on the exchange rates and fuel prices at the time of publishing. Whilst we make every effort to ensure that prices are accurate at the time of publishing, we cannot guarantee these prices.</p>
                <p>Our prices are subject to surcharges on the following: currency fluctuations, Government Actions (for example, changes in the rates of Value Added Tax), aircraft fuel, overflying charges and airport charges. Only if the amount of any increase in our costs exceeds 2% of the total cost of your holiday will we levy a surcharge. The price of your holiday may increase after you have booked but no later than 30 days before the departure date stipulated and we will forward you an amended invoice reflecting any changes made.  If the increase means paying more than 10% extra on your holiday price you will be entitled to cancel with a full refund of all money paid to us. Should you decide to cancel because of this you must do so within 14 days of receiving the invoice for the balance of your holiday. This invoice is normally issued 11 weeks before departure. Once you have paid for your holiday in full together with surcharges (if any) we guarantee that no further surcharges will be made.</p>
                <p>Should you instruct your credit/debit card company to “charge back” any payment(s) properly due from you in respect of your booking, we will charge you an administrative fee of £10 per incident and associated costs. We further reserve the right to cancel your booking and/or take legal action against you for all outstanding payments.</p>
                <h4>Flights</h4>
                <p>You can choose whether or not you would like us to book your flight.</p>
                <p>For flight inclusive holidays, the price includes a flight allowance of £130 and an additional administration fee of £25. We purchase your flight ticket as soon as we receive a deposit from you and at that time we will be able to fix the normal cost of your holiday. If the actual cost of the flight is higher than the budget figure we will ask for your confirmation before proceeding. The difference between the budget figure and actual cost will be reflected as an additional charge or as a deduction in your confirmation invoice. Once we have booked your flight, we will forward you the booking details by email so that you can provide the flight operator with your personal information (including passport details) and print off your boarding pass.</p>
                <p>If you book your own flight, you must ensure that it is scheduled to land at the specified airport before the time communicated by us at the time of booking, in order to ensure that your arrival coincides with the transfer departure times to resort. We will confirm the airport and transfer depart time on our Confirmation Invoice and this will then form part of the contract with you. Once you have booked your flight, you must send us the flight details and these must be sent at the latest when you pay the balance of your holiday.</p>
                <h4>Alterations</h4>
                <p>We hope and expect to be able to provide you with the holiday we have confirmed to you at the time of booking. However, because we make arrangements many months in advance and use the services of independent suppliers (such as airlines, hotels etc.) over whom we have no direct control, we occasionally do need to make changes. We reserve the right to do so at any time and will let you know as soon as we can. Most such changes are minor but occasionally we may have to make a significant change.</p>
                <h4>Major changes</h4>
                <p>A major change is one that we make to your holiday arrangements before departure that involves a change by us of a flight time by more than 12 hours, a change of your departure or arrival airport to one that is significantly more inconvenient to you, a change of resort or a change of accommodation to that of a lower standard. If a major change becomes necessary we will inform you as soon as we can before you depart. If we advise you of a major change before your departure, then unless it relates to circumstances amounting to force majeure (see below) you have 3 options:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Accept the alternative holiday offered “at additional cost if applicable”</li>
                    <li>Purchase another available holiday from us at the prices that apply at that time. If it is cheaper than the original holiday purchased, we will refund the price difference and if it is more expensive you will be charged for the difference.</li>
                    <li>Cancel your holiday with full refund of all monies paid.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Compensation</h4>
                <p>In all of these cases including cancellation by us, compensation of £25 per person will be paid if the major change is notified to you less than 21 days before your scheduled departure.</p>
                <h4>Cancellation by us</h4>
                <p>We aim to provide the holiday as booked. But if, for example, not enough people booked on your holiday or if suppliers over whom we have no direct control make significant changes, we may have to cancel the holiday.</p>
                <p>If we cancel your holiday, except where this is because you have not paid, we will offer you the 3 options mentioned above. We will not cancel your holiday within 6 weeks of departure unless for reasons beyond our control (see ‘Important Note: Events beyond our control below’).</p>
                <h4>Important Note: events beyond our control</h4>
                <p>We will not pay any compensation for changes caused by reason of war or threat of war, riots, civil strife, terrorist activity, industrial disputes, natural or nuclear disasters, fire, technical problems of transport, closure or congestion of airports, adverse weather conditions, epidemics, health risks, changes due to rescheduling or cancellation of flights by an airline or alteration of the airline or aircraft type for reasons beyond our control or that of our suppliers, or events or circumstances beyond our control amounting to force majeure and Acts of God.</p>
                <p>In February 2005 a new Europe-wide law relating to denied boarding, delays and cancellation of flights came into force. This law granted rights to passengers including in certain circumstances the right to cancel their flight and receive reimbursement of the cost of the flight from their airline. Full details of these rights is publicised at EU airports and is also available from affected airlines. However, you should note that reimbursement of the cost of a flight that forms part of your holiday is the responsibility of your holiday airline and will not automatically entitle you to reimbursement of the cost of your holiday from us.</p>
                <h4>Consumer protection</h4>
                <p>The Mountain Experience Company Limited is a Travel Trust Association (TTA) Member (membership number Q3634). Every TTA member deposits the money paid for a holiday into the Trust Account which is a bank account designated to hold the customer's money. Your money remains in the Trust Account and is supervised by an appointed trustee who is either a banker, chartered or certified accountant or a solicitor. In addition to your money being held in trust, the TTA will guarantee the financial obligation of its members up to a maximum for any one passenger of £11,000. So if you paid £2,000 the TTA  guarantees it will reimburse the loss of the £2,000, where it is not available for you from the Trust Account. Therefore, the Trust Account plus the guarantee will ensure that all the money which you have paid is safely protected and available to reimburse the money paid. When you make a booking, you will be supplied with a guarantee certificate – you can see the terms of the guarantee on www.traveltrust.co.uk/guarantee. Should the TTA member become insolvent, in most instances your money will still be held within the TTA member’s Trust Account by the designated Trustee, and available to pay for your holiday. If because of fraud or dishonesty the money is not there, then the guarantee is available to reimburse your loss. In some cases your holiday may continue as the providers or suppliers have already been paid. Where you have only paid a deposit and still have an outstanding balance, your holiday may be unaffected and by paying the balance your holiday will continue as planned. Where possible, attempts will be made to ensure that you can carry on with your original holiday arrangements.</p>
                <h4>Snow and weather conditions</h4>
                <p>We cannot accept responsibility for the snow or weather conditions experienced during your holiday or the effect these may have on your travel arrangements, accommodation, skiing or ski instruction. Nor do we offer a snow guarantee but we have specially chosen resorts which should provide good snow conditions.</p>
                <h4>Refunds</h4>
                <p>We will not make any refund to you for unused portions of air, bus or other tickets, unused accommodation or meals, unused ski hire, ski lift passes or ski instruction. No representative or agent of The Mountain Experience Company Limited is authorised to promise or make any refund to you.</p>
                <h4>Personal injury</h4>
                <p>If you suffer injury, illness or death directly as a result of the services provided as part of your holiday, we may make a payment to you. We will not make a payment if your injury, illness or death was caused by an event or circumstances which the person who caused it could not have predicted or avoided even if they had taken all necessary and due care. We will not make any payment if your illness, injury or death was your own fault. If we do make a payment, it would be similar to one you would receive under English Law in an English law court. We will make such payments for injury, illness or death on the following basis:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You must tell us and the supplier involved about your injury or illness while you are in the resort.</li>
                    <li>You should also write to The Mountain Experience Company Limited about your claim within 3 months of coming home from your holiday to allow us to investigate it properly and co-operate with us so as to enable us to carry out such investigation. You should transfer to us any rights you have against the supplier or any other person.</li>
                    <li>You should co-operate fully with us if we or our insurers want to enforce those rights. Any payments we make may be limited in accordance with international conventions. We ask you to transfer your rights to us so that we can claim back from suppliers any payments we make to you, plus any legal or other costs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Should you or any member of your party suffer illness, personal injury or death, through any misadventure during your holiday overseas arising out of an activity which does not form part of your holiday arrangements we shall offer you assistance in pursuing any claim you intend to make against the offending party. Where a payment is made you are bound to provide all reasonable help to enable us to pursue a claim against the third party and assign to us your rights of action.</p>
                <h4>Complaints</h4>
                <p>On arrival at your holiday destination you will be provided with an information pack containing contact details for the local representative of Classic Alpine Ski Club who will deal with any problems or complaints that might arise during your holiday. If you have a complaint we will try to resolve it during your holiday in an amicable way. However, in the unlikely event of it not being resolved to your satisfaction you may of course refer the matter to arbitration under the Travel Industry Arbitration Service’s special scheme which provides for a simple and inexpensive method of arbitration. This scheme does not apply to claims for an amount greater than £2,500 per person or £10,000 per booking form or to claims which are solely or mainly in respect of physical injury or illness or the consequences of such injury or illness. Details of the scheme can be supplied upon request.</p>
                <h3>YOUR COMMITMENT TO US</h3>
                <h4>Booking</h4>
                <p>When you make your booking you must complete and sign a booking form and send it to us, by post or email, and make the appropriate payment (see below). Whether you book alone or as a group, we will only deal with the lead booking name in all subsequent correspondence, including changes, amendments and cancellations. When you sign the booking form you are confirming on behalf of all your party that you understand and have accepted these Booking Conditions and all other information in this brochure relevant to your holiday. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the personal details or any other information supplied in respect of yourself and any other person travelling on the booking and for passing on any information regarding the booking or any changes made in relation thereto, to all persons travelling on such booking, including but not limited to information on schedule changes or copies of booking confirmations.</p>
                <p>If you are booking a flight-inclusive holiday you must show your first name, and that of other members of your party, exactly as recorded on your passport as this must match your flight ticket. You are also responsible for  notifying us a) at the time of booking of any personal circumstances and needs pertaining to a person with reduced mobility – for example, if anyone in the party has difficulty in walking more than 500 metres; and b) at any time from the time of booking until 48 hours prior to the flight’s departure if any person travelling on the booking has ceased to be self-reliant or a person with reduced mobility or if a person previously reported to be with reduced mobility or as not being self-reliant does no longer fall into either category.</p>
                <h4>Insurance</h4>
                <p>It is a condition of booking a holiday with us that you and all other members of your party obtain Travel and Winter Sports insurance. If you are unable to supply details of sufficient travel insurance when you pay the balance of the cost of the holiday, or a signed waiver, then we will be unable to issue your final travel documents. We highly recommend that you obtain travel insurance at the time of booking, as this will provide cover in case you need to cancel your booking prior to departure. It is vital to ensure that your travel insurance policy provides adequate cover for cancellation, missed departure, unused accommodation and all activities that you plan to undertake, including skiing off-piste. It is your responsibility to check carefully whether there are any age restrictions on the insurance policy.</p>
                <h4>Late arrivals, delay and denied boarding</h4>
                <p>We cannot accept responsibility if you miss your flight or transfer due to late check in, check-in queues, delays in connecting transport or delays introduced by security procedures.</p>
                <h4>Payment</h4>

                <p>The booking form must be accompanied by a non-refundable deposit of £250 per person per holiday, plus
                    £155 for flight-inclusive holidays. When the booking is accepted we will issue a Confirmation of
                    Booking Invoice by e-mail and a contract will exist between us from the date that this invoice is
                    issued. An invoice for the balance of the cost of your holiday will be issued 11 weeks before
                    departure by e-mail. In the event of circumstances arising between your booking being accepted and
                    the balance invoice being issued that give rise to a surcharge, this will be shown on the balance
                    invoice. You must pay the balance of your holiday at least 8 weeks before your departure date. If
                    you don’t, we reserve the right to cancel your booking, retain the deposit and apply the
                    cancellation charges detailed below.</p>
                <p>If you make your holiday booking within 8 weeks of your departure date then you must pay the full cost at the booking stage and a contract will exist when we accept your payment.</p>
                <p>Credit card payments will be subject to a 2% or 3% fee depending on the card type. There is no service charge levied by us for debit card or BACS payments.</p>
                <h4>Your alterations</h4>
                <p>If after your holiday has been confirmed you want to change to another resort or change the departure date or accommodation, we will do our utmost to make this possible provided written notification is received at our office from the person who signed the booking form. An administration fee of £50 per person will be charged together with any additional costs of the new holiday. Changes within 8 weeks of departure are treated as cancellations of the original booking and cancellation charges will apply. For flight-inclusive holidays any name changes required after flights have been confirmed will be subject to an additional charge of up to £150 in respect of additional costs imposed by the airline.</p>
                <h4>Your cancellation</h4>
                <p>If you or anyone on your holiday booking decides to cancel the holiday or part of it we must be notified in writing. The cancellation will take effect from the day the written confirmation is received by recorded delivery. If the cancellation results in a person travelling alone, a single room supplement is payable. The following scale shows the amount payable on cancellation, depending upon when we receive your written instructions:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>When we receive notification</td>
                        <td>Cancellation charges as % of total holiday cost</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>More than 56 days</td>
                        <td>Deposit forfeited</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>55 to 35 days</td>
                        <td>45%</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>34 to 21 days</td>
                        <td>60%</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>20 to 8 days</td>
                        <td>90%</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>7 days or less</td>
                        <td>100%</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <h4>Your behaviour and responsibility</h4>
                <p>You and your party undertake to behave in a fair and responsible way towards the Classic Alpine Ski Club, its clients and those who provide elements of your holiday. If you fail to do so we have the right to terminate your holiday and we will have no further obligations towards you. Any costs that result from improper action by any member of your party are your responsibility.</p>
                <p>You must advise us of any medical condition or disability that may affect your ability to travel or take part in your holiday. If you do not do so you will be responsible for all resulting consequences and costs.</p>
                <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>In order to process your booking and to ensure that your travel arrangements run smoothly and meet your requirements, we need to use the information you provide such as your name, and address, any special needs/dietary requirements etc. We take full responsibility for ensuring that proper security measures are in place to protect your information. We must pass the information on to the relevant suppliers of your travel arrangements such as airlines, hotels, transport companies, lift pass operators and so on. The information may also be provided to security or credit checking companies, public authorities such as customs and immigration if required by them, or as required by law. This applies to any sensitive information that you give to us such as details of any disabilities, or dietary/religious requirements. If, however, we cannot pass this information to the relevant suppliers, we cannot accept your booking. In making a booking, you consent to this information being passed on to the relevant persons. You are entitled to a copy of your information held by us. If you would like to see this please contact us during normal working hours. (We make a small charge for providing this to you.)</p>
                <p>The information you are required to provide may include debit/credit card details. As set out above, we take full responsibility for ensuring that proper security measures are in place to protect this information. In accordance with applicable legal, regulatory and business requirements this information will be securely deleted as soon as it is no longer required. By agreeing to these terms and conditions you hereby consent to The Mountain Experience Company Limited sharing your personal data.</p>
                <p>We will use your personal information to provide you with information about other goods and services The Mountain Experience Company Limited offers that are similar to those that you have already purchased or enquired  about and to notify you about changes to The Mountain Experience Company Limited service.</p>
                <p>We do not sell individual customer names or other private profile information to third parties. The Mountain Experience Company Limited may disclose your personal information to third parties in the event that it sells or buys any business or assets, in which case it may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets. The information we provide to such third parties is protected by a confidentiality agreement.</p>
